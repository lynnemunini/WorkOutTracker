Built an exercise tracking application using python and google sheets.
Tracks the workout that i'm doing, what time, how long i've been doing the exercise and the amount of calories i've used up as well.
Once i enter what i have done in the User Interface, the values are updated on my google sheet. Used the Nutritionix API v2 to track calories expended while exercising.
Sheety API used to add values to my google sheet
